Total Ordered Multicast:

1. Byzantine
Currently, we assume that processes honestly select their sequence numbers A_g and P_g. The easiest solution is to perform the Max-PhaseKing algorithm on the gathered sequence numbers to get the highest of them (if all processes are honest) or an even higher one (if there are malicious processes)

2. Crash Fault Tolerance:
Furthermore, we have to cover the case that not each of the N processes proposes a sequence number. 
    i) For each process p_i and p_j, p_i adds a timestamp to the first message of p_j in the holdback queue
    ii) periodically check for timeouts
    iii) send and collect suspend messages similar to phaseking 
    iv) suspend servers if necessary
