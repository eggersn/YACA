  abstract  = {Broad and up-to-date coverage of the principles and practice in the fast moving area of Distributed Systems. Distributed Systems provides students of computer science and engineering with the skills they will need to design and maintain software for distributed applications. It will also be invaluable to software engineers and systems designers wishing to understand new and future developments in the field. From mobile phones to the Internet, our lives depend increasingly on distributed systems linking computers and other devices together in a seamless and transparent way. The fifth edition of this best-selling text continues to provide a comprehensive source of material on the principles and practice of distributed computer systems and the exciting new developments based on them, using a wealth of modern case studies to illustrate their design and development. The depth of coverage will enable readers to evaluate existing distributed systems and design new ones.}

title = "Cloture Votes:n/4-resilient Distributed Consensus in t + 1 rounds",
abstract = "The Distributed Consensus problem involves n processors each of which holds an initial binary value. At most t processors may be faulty and ignore any protocol (even behaving maliciously), yet it is required that the nonfaulty processors eventually agree on a value that was initially held by one of them. We measure the quality of a consensus protocol using the following parameters; total number of processors n, number of rounds of message exchange r, and maximal message size m. The known lower bounds are respectively 3 t + 1, t + 1, and 1. While no known protocol is optimal in all these three aspects simultaneously, Cloture Votes-the protocol presented in this paper-takes further steps in this direction, by making consensus possible with n = 4 t + 1, r = t + 1, and polynomial message size. Cloture is a parliamentary procedure (also known as {"}parliamentary guillotine{"}) which makes it possible to curtail unnecessary long debates. In our protocol the unanimous will of the correct processors (akin to parliamentarian supermajority) may curtail the debate. This is facilitated by having the processors open in each round a new process (debate), which either ends quickly, with the conclusion {"}continue{"} or {"}terminate with the default value,{"} or lasts through many rounds. Importantly, in the latter case the messages being sent are short.",
